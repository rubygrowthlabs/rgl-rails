# rgl-rails

Rails 8 + Full Hotwire Stack skills plugin for Claude Code by [Ruby Growth Labs](https://rubygrowthlabs.com).

## What's Included

7 domain-scoped skills covering the complete Rails + Hotwire stack:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **rails-architecture** | DHH-style architecture, fat models, thin controllers, REST mapping, Minitest |
| **turbo-navigation** | Turbo Drive caching, Turbo Frames for tabs, pagination, lazy loading, faceted search |
| **turbo-streams** | Real-time updates, broadcasting, custom actions, Turbo 8 morphing, optimistic UI |
| **stimulus-controllers** | Lifecycle, values, targets, outlets, action parameters, production controllers |
| **forms-validation** | Inline editing, modal forms, typeahead, external form controls, submission lifecycle |
| **hotwire-native** | Turbo iOS/Android, path configuration, Strada bridge components, native auth |
| **frontend-craft** | CSS @layer, loading indicators, view transitions, optimistic morphing, frame spinners |

## Two-Layer Knowledge Architecture

Each skill contains two complementary knowledge layers:

- **`references/`** — Synthesized, opinionated guidance: pattern cards, guardrails, DHH-style recommendations ("what to do and why")
- **`handbook/`** — Official Turbo, Stimulus, and Hotwire Native documentation: precise API specs, attribute names, event names, action descriptors ("what exists and how it works")

The `references/` layer tells you the right pattern. The `handbook/` layer gives you the exact API details to implement it correctly.
